## Solution

To solve Natas Level 11:

- **Inspect the Source Page:** The source code introduces a filter that blocks characters such as `;`, `|`, and `&` to prevent command injection. However, it does not block the use of wildcards like `.` or `*`.

  1. The filter prevents the use of some special characters, but we can use the wildcard `.` to read files.
  2. To retrieve the password for Natas Level 12, we inject the following command into the input field:
     - ```bash
       . /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 #
       ```
  3. Submitting this will display the password for the next level.

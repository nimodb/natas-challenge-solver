## Solution

To solve Natas Level 2:

- **Access the Source Code:** The password for the next level is hidden in the HTML source code of the webpage but the page has JavaScript function that blocks right-clicking to prevent access to the context menu for viewing the page source. However, this can be bypassed easily.

  1. **Open the webpage for Natas Level 2:** http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org

  2. **Bypassing the Block:** You can still view the page source using any of the following methods:
    - **Method 1:** Press `Ctrl + U` (Windows/Linux) or `cmd + Option + U` (Mac) to directly view the page source.
    - **Method 2:** Open the browser's developer tools by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac), and manually inspect the HTML.

  3. Looks for **comments** or **hidden elements** in HTML code that may contain the password.
